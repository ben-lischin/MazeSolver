# Maze Solver
## Creating the maze
This program implements Kruskal's algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree, and draws the maze accordingly.
## Solving the maze
Optionally enter maze dimensions as command-line arguments to generate a maze of that size. If no dimensions are specified, the maze will be of size 30x50.\
Try to solve the maze yourself! Go from the green tile to the pink tile.\
For interacting, you have 4 key commands:
- "d" - visualize a depth-first search to complete the maze
- "b" - visualize a breadth-first search to complete the maze
- " " - at any point in the search, you can pause/resume the animation
- "r" - at any point in the search, or after it is completed, you can reset to a fresh maze

After the search reaches the end, it will trace back the shortest path in white
